## Whistleblower Policy

If you are a whistleblower, please cover your tracks.
We cannot explain to you how to do this, for the sake of liability.

## Research Preservation Policy

Any contributions will be downloaded and backed up independently, this is to ensure any attempt at a takedown notice or removal can be circumvented. We do not think this is a realistic possibility, but OpenAI and other AI providers have a tendency to dislike potential 'harmful' information from being disclosed.
You have all rights to your own contributions, & to submit these where you need - including Press/Media.
