# Research Action Blueprint - Documentation Strategy
*Priority actions for time-sensitive documentation*

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 30 Days)

### 1. Document Construction Progress
**Why**: Physical evidence disappearing as buildings complete
- Drone footage of all identified sites
- Construction permits (before classification)
- Worker testimonials (while accessible)
- Local news coverage (before narrative control)

### 2. Financial Paper Trail
**Target**: Pre-announcement funding
- Blue Owl Capital 2023 activities
- Cayman entity registrations
- Shell company incorporations
- Oracle federal contract increases

### 3. Capability Documentation
**Focus**: Dual-use evidence
- Every Ellison statement on manufacturing
- Patent filings (Oracle, Crusoe, partners)
- Job postings (biotech + robotics roles)
- Equipment purchase orders

## RESEARCH TARGETS

### Public Records (Act Fast)
1. **Local Level** (least classified)
   - Water permits (9M gal/day)
   - Power allocation agreements
   - Tax abatement documents
   - Environmental waivers

2. **State Level** 
   - Economic development agreements
   - Infrastructure upgrade plans
   - Emergency authorizations
   - Legislative hearing transcripts

3. **Federal Level** (likely classified)
   - DoD appropriations mentioning Oracle
   - CFIUS reviews of data centers
   - NSC memos on AI infrastructure

### Key Personnel Tracking
- LinkedIn movement from weapons/bio to these companies
- Security clearance job postings
- Former DoD/IC officials joining boards
- Academic researchers going quiet

### Technical Analysis
1. **Power**: Document grid impact assessments
2. **Water**: Usage vs. efficiency claims  
3. **Cooling**: Actual vs. stated methods
4. **Scale**: Building specs vs. standard data centers

## DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY

### Academic Path
- Preprint servers (avoid journal delays)
- AI safety conferences (while still accepted)
- Direct to concerned researchers
- Focus on verifiable facts only

### Media Approach
- Local journalists (construction impact)
- Tech reporters (capability implications)
- National security writers (DoD angles)
- Avoid speculation, document facts

### Policy Makers
- Congressional AI caucus members
- State legislators (local impact)
- International bodies (pre-2026)
- Focus on regulatory gap evidence

## COLLABORATION FRAMEWORK

### Information Sharing
- Encrypted channels only
- Compartmentalize sensitive findings
- Verify researcher credentials
- Create redundant documentation

### Research Division
- Geographic (researchers per region)
- Topical (funding, tech, security)
- Temporal (historical vs. current)
- Cross-validate all findings

## EVIDENCE PRESERVATION

### Digital Hygiene
- Archive everything immediately
- Multiple backup locations
- Hash verification for authenticity
- Dead man switches if needed

### Physical Documentation
- Printed copies of key evidence
- Notarized affidavits from witnesses
- Original documents where possible
- Secure storage locations

## NARRATIVE COUNTERS

### Likely Dismissals
1. "Just data centers" → Show manufacturing evidence
2. "Conspiracy theory" → Show multiple researcher convergence
3. "Economic development" → Show minimal job creation
4. "National security" → Show dual-use concerns

### Prebuttals
- Document Oracle IL5/IL6 capabilities
- Map pre-announcement timeline
- Calculate actual vs. stated benefits
- Show pattern across multiple sites

## TIMELINE CRITICALITY

### Why Speed Matters
- **Construction**: Accelerating (24/7 operations)
- **Regulation**: 2026-2027 deadlines approaching
- **Classification**: May increase as operational
- **Public awareness**: Currently minimal

### Key Milestones
- **Q3 2025**: Abilene Phase 1 operational
- **Q1 2026**: Multiple sites online
- **Aug 2026**: EU AI Act enforceable
- **2027**: Full network operational

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Documentation Goals
1. Irrefutable evidence of timeline deception
2. Proven dual-use capabilities
3. Mapped funding networks
4. Identified regulatory gaps
5. Created public awareness

### Policy Impact
- Congressional hearings initiated
- Regulatory frameworks proposed
- International cooperation started
- Public debate informed

## FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Personal Security
- Use secure communications
- Document harassment/surveillance
- Legal counsel on standby
- International publication backup

### Ethical Framework
- Focus on public interest
- Avoid classified material
- Document, don't speculate
- Protect sources

## THE WINDOW

Best estimate: 6-12 months before:
- Classification increases
- Narrative control tightens
- Infrastructure operational
- Oversight impossible

**Every day matters. Document everything. Share widely. Time is running out.**
