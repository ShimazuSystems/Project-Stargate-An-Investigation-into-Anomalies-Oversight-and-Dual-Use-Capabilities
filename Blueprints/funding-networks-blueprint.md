## RED FLAGS

### Timeline Anomalies
- Blue Owl organizing capital 2023
- Construction begins June 2024
- Corporate formation January 2025
- **Conclusion**: 18+ month pre-planning under classification

### Scale Mismatch
- Public announcement: $500B
- Actual commitments: ~$1T across industry
- Individual projects: Matching entire Stargate budget

### Cayman Connection
- Second funding pool registered offshore
- Classic structure for classified programs
- Enables funding opacity

## FUNDING PATTERN
Pre-positioned capital → Shell companies → Rapid deployment → Tax optimization → Minimal local benefit

**CRITICAL**: Funding timeline proves classified pre-authorization. Commercial entities don't fund $15B+ projects 18 months before announcement.
