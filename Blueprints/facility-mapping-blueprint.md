### Meta Louisiana
- **Location**: Monroe, Richland Parish
- **Scale**: 4M sqft (world's largest Meta DC)
- **Power**: Seeking 4GW nuclear capacity
- **Timeline**: Construction through 2030

## PATTERN LOCATIONS (Following Stargate Model)

### Confirmed Oracle Mega-Sites
- **Salt Lake City**: "8 Boeing 747s nose-to-tail"
- **Indiana**: Part of $10B expansion
- **Minnesota**: Rosemont campus
- **Alabama**: Montgomery site

### DoD Proximity Pattern
- Fort Campbell area (bridges collapsed under M10 tank)
- Fort Bragg vicinity (infrastructure upgrades)
- Wright-Patterson AFB region (unconfirmed)

### International Expansion
- **UAE**: Confirmed Stargate, 2026 operational
- **Saudi Arabia**: Neom $5B AI center
- **South Korea**: $3.5B project starting 2025
- **Singapore**: Multiple expansions underway

## SITE SELECTION CRITERIA

### Must-Have Infrastructure
1. **Power**: 1GW+ capacity or ability to build
2. **Water**: 5-10M gallons/day access
3. **Military**: <50km from logistics hub
4. **Fiber**: Major corridor proximity
5. **Land**: 500-1000 acres available

### Regulatory Factors
- States with limited AI oversight
- Tax incentive availability
- Expedited permitting
- Federal land adjacency (bypasses local)

## VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY

### Satellite Confirmation
- Construction visible June 2024 (pre-announcement)
- Rapid buildout 40,000 sqm/month
- Infrastructure patterns match pharma/biotech

### Public Records
- "Project Ludicrous" TDLR filings
- DRI applications (Project Sail)
- Power interconnection requests
- Water permits showing massive usage

## THE 20+ NETWORK

Per Ellison: 10 buildings Abilene + "20 other locations"
- https://www.racksolutions.com/news/blog/stargate-project-data-center/

### Likely Additional Sites
- **Arizona**: Desert locations, nuclear proximity
- **Nevada**: Federal land availability
- **Virginia**: Despite power constraints
- **Texas**: Multiple sites beyond Abilene
- **International**: 5-10 sites across allies

## MAPPING RESOURCES
- ERCOT queue data (Texas power requests)
- State DRI filings (regional impact)
- DoD installation maps (proximity analysis)
- Nuclear plant locations (power sourcing)

## KEY PATTERN
Every site: Shell company → Power/military proximity → Massive scale → Minimal jobs → Tax breaks → Water concerns → Community opposition

**CRITICAL**: Geographic distribution enables global deployment within 24-48 hours of any location. No coincidence - designed for rapid worldwide distribution of whatever these facilities produce.
